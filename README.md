            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello ny name is Jerel Wilson. I am a call center salesman turned web develper.
            You can think of this page has always under contruction. Over time when i make new projects I will leave links for them on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am still trying to figure out how to fill out this page and I will need to figure out if I should add other things to this page. One one hand I think it             will help fill out <b>THIS</b> page but on the <b><em>OTHER</b></em> hand. I don't think any future employers are gonna care about my Trumpet                           playing abilties or Record Producing that I've done but I will leave a link to my Soundcloud page. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dj-no-face-1">Click Here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Please keep in mind that I haven't added an new sounds to my Souncloud page in years so please be <ins><b>VERY</b></ins> understanding when you listening to my Instumentals.
            </p>             
            <p>
                So I <b>MAY</b> not attach a CSS file to this page. Only because in the future I will plan to make other pages. I may add some pictures to this just to some that             I have some range of Front-End Development skills. 
            </p>
              <p>
              I'm also gonna include a link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerel-wilson-82b79b176">Linkedin</a> profile here. Hopefully if I did this right You should be able to click the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerel-wilson-82b79b176">Linkedin</a> in the last sentence and in <b><ins>THIS</ins></b> sentence as well. </p>

            So this is me trying to create more content for the page. I went ahead and downloaded Visual Studio Code! So While I have it for my laptop I still cannot push the code from my laptop too Github. Idid download a clone forr my work here and i am able to work on it but I'm not able to push and of the updates to Github. Also sidenote: I like the idea of making a section of this webpage a diary for my growing pains of learning how to code. That sounds like a way to actually have content on my page and hopefully A little bit of a map for me to look back on.
               </p>

            I'm working on a <b>BRAND NEW</b> Portfolio page. This one will be interactivate and will be the new home for me to showcase my skills. and this will be a way better page than this one. I do wonder if if this means that all of my green commits will dissapear? I <i><ins>HOPE</i></ins> it doesn't.
               </p>
             <h3>9/13/22</h3>

            Today Im going to try and push code from Git to Github today! It <i><ins>LIVES</i></ins> I figured out how to push code from my laptop through Git to Github using the Command Line! You might actually call me a command Line Hero! Well <b>I</b> am going to call myself a command Line Hero.

            Today all I did is a couple of lessons on Codeacademy it was a long day so iI'm gonna turn in early.

            Today I learned that sometimes you need to reconnect your Git account to your GitHub profile. It's been awhile since I've pushed something from Git (GitBash)to GitHub, but after doing some quick research I heard that I needed to learn about <B>Pull</b> requests.
            <br></br>
             <ins><b><u>To fix the issue I ran</ins></b></u>:
            <br></br>
             <i>git pull origin master</i>
            <br></br>And Then I Ran<br></br>
             <i>git push origin master</i>
            <br></br>
            Honestly I'm starting to learn tht google is my friend and my ally. Overtime I actually have faith that this will get eaiser but for now I'll go ahead and end this blog post here. Also did a couple of Modules on Codeacademy.

            i took a break for awhile because i was getting fustrated with coding but I'm back Today I started <b>React!</b>. Well really it was JSX. Its coll to add header elements with javascript classes with const.

              <p>
            Today i started REACT!!!. Finally getting into the beast that is React. It's seems like I need to learn JSX first. Which is just a javascript library and is a good combo of HTML & Javascirpt. Really excitied to see what is to come.

            Finished doing the first part of React. I learned that doing React is alot of ES6+ and different javascript programs like JSX. So far enjoying everything but I need to keep going!

            I forgot to post yesterday. We started using props. Which they say we are not actually useful but it seems like something a manager would use to give someone notes on a bit of code.
