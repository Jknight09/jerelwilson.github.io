            <p>
            Hello ny name is Jerel Wilson. I am a call center salesman turned web develper.
            I satrted my coding Journey about 2 years ago and I have been learning at a extremly fast pace.
            You can think of this page has always under contruction. Over time when i make new projects I will leave links for them on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am still trying to figure out how to fill out this page and I will need to figure out if I should add other things to this page. One one hand I think it             will help fill out <b>THIS</b> page but on the <b><em>OTHER</b></em> hand. I don't think any future employers are gonna care about my Trumpet                           playing abilties or Record Producing that I've done but I will leave a link to my Soundcloud page. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dj-no-face-1">Click Here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            So I will not attach a CSS file to this page. Only because in the future I will plan to make other pages. I may add some pictures to this just to some that             I have some range of Front-End Development skills. 
            </p>
